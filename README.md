# My suckless forks/configs
In case I ever reinstall linux, I can use this to save me a LOTTTTTT of time. <br/><br/>
This "rice" isn't that impressive, but it looks quite nice for me. <br/><br/>
I really recommend you to make your dwm config, as it's quite fun and rewarding.<br/><br/>

things that you need: picom (the development branch), pipewire (use alt + f9(mute), f11(decrease), and f12(increase)) for volume, feh, and other dwm dependencies which can be found somewhere online or on youtube. <br/><br/>
I even added the patches folder so you can see what I did.<br/><br/>

Again, I really only made this for myself (NOT TO BE SELFISH), but you're open to use it. However I really recommend you to make your own config, and to only use my config if you already know how to do everything and want to save time.<br/><br/>

also make sure you configue ur .xinitrc to do the cool things automatically. Mine is: <br/>
~/.fehbg &<br/>
picom -b<br/>
slstatus &<br/>
exec dwm<br/>

<br/>
Also, you have to configure feh to display your background, the command should be `feh --bg-center /path/to/wallpaper/` <br/>
